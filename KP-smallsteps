1. What we have done now

Java chat window which will interact with user. Currently handling Hi, Hello and Bye words only

Working on the Action Context : each Action (like find file or find folder) will have an Action Code

ActionCodes could be like this : first two letters action (we are starting with DA,DB just saving a,b,c series for later use)

DA - find something (search, get me etc..)
DB - move
DC - copy

The last char of the Action Code is what is the object the action is acted on 

A - file
B - folder

so for finding a file the action code will be DAA (DA is find and A is file) for copy folder the action code will be DCB
