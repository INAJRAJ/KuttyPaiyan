1. What we have done now

Java chat window which will interact with user. Currently handling Hi, Hello and Bye words only

Working on the Action Context : each Action (like find file or find folder) will have an Action Code

ActionCodes could be like this : first two letters action (we are starting with DA,DB just saving a,b,c series for later use)

DA - find something (search, get me etc..)
DB - move
DC - copy

The last char of the Action Code is what is the object the action is acted on 

A - file
B - folder

so for finding a file the action code will be DAA (DA is find and A is file) for copy folder the action code will be DCB

Each Action will have an ActionContext - For each Action ActionContext contents will differ for example lets say for DAA which
is to find a file will have some properties like this in the Action Context - filename, where to begin, recursive search etc

! Need to create a set of properties for each Action (ActionContextProperties.txt)

There will be three lists as of now
1. all The action codes with the possible words --> map(string , list<string>) --> map <word , actioncode>
2. context map for each action code --> map(string, map<string,string>)
3. the words to be considered as noise --> list<string>
